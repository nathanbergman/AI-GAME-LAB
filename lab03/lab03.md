# Prompt Engineering Process
<h3>Started with llama 3.2, lots of emotion and loaded up a dnd session with the AI being a DM. It created a story:</h3>

<h3>To try and improve the model, I added more max tokens, going from 100 -> 300</h3>
This didn't seem to do much, after multiple attempts talking to the model it generates slightly different, but overall similiar stories. 

<h3>I changed the messages to the model, going from acting as a human to giving it instructions to be a DM .</h3>

<h3>I gave the model more instructions, based on the instructions in the README</h3>
This proved successful, the combat system worked.
