# Prompt Engineering Process

Llama 3.2 was used
## Step 1

#### Intention
> To try and improve the model, I added more max tokens, going from 100 -> 300

#### Action/Change
>This can lead to more detailed and complex responses, for DND it can create better descriptions, better combat and better dialogue.

#### Result
>I didn't seem to notice a difference.

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>This change was either not significant enough or I wasn't going deep enough in detail in my prompts.

## Step 2

#### Intention
>I edited the messages to the model, from simply acting as a human to being a DM for a DND session. 

#### Action/Change
>I felt that this would give the model more accurate responses, without having to tell the model what it's task is. 

#### Result
>It proved to be a better result

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>The model still did not provide what was asked in the project-lab-README

## Step 3

#### Intention
>I further refined the messages, with the instructions of the project-lab-README in mind, having it generate a story, create NPC characters, manage the game world, make changes to character sheets, and implement a turn-based combat system. 

#### Action/Change
>I think that this will further progress the agent in the intended direction. 

#### Result
>It proved successful, I tested a couple of turns of the combat system. 

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>More implementation is needed to satisfy all the requirements asked.
## Step 4

#### Intention
>Changed the temperature from 0.5 to 0.7 to boost creativity.

#### Action/Change
>A DM has to be creative, so this change will hopefully have better responses and creative storytelling.

#### Result
>It was more creative.

#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>This may be a double-edged sword, the higher the temperature, the more it could go off course and generate wrong answers.




<h3>I changed the messages to the model, going from acting as a human to giving it instructions to be a DM .</h3>




<h3>I gave the model more instructions, based on the instructions in the README</h3>
This proved successful, the combat system worked.
